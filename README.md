# Hey there, I'm Richie!

I'm a private race engineer and PhD student at The University of the Witwatersrand working on Motorsport and Optimal Control projects.
- The main focus of my research is motorsport performance, a niche field of applied optimization. 
- Here you'll find my journey as an engineer from camshaft design to laptime simulation codes and everything in between.
