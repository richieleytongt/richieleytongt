# Hey there, I'm Richie!

I'm a private race engineer and PhD student at The University of the Witwatersrand working on Motorsport and Optimal Control projects. I received my Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the University of South Florida, and my MSc in Motorsport Engineering from Oxford Brookes University.
- The main focus of my research is applied optimal control. 
- Here you'll find my journey as an engineer from camshaft design to laptime simulation codes and everything in between.
